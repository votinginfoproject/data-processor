# VIP Data Processor

The VIP Data Processor listens to an [AWS SQS][SQS] queue for messages
about new data uploads to an [AWS S3][S3] bucket. It downloads the
data and validates it. Results are stored and able to distribute or be
reported upon.

[SQS]: http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/
[S3]: http://aws.amazon.com/s3/

## Running

### lein

To run the processor against a local .zip, you'll need Postgres
running and a minimal conifguration file.

Create `dev-resources/config.edn` with a map that looks like the
following (using values for your Postgres server):

```clj
{:postgres {:database "dataprocessor"
            :host "localhost"
            :port 5432
            :user "dataprocessor"
            :password nil}}
```

Then use `lein run` to process a zip file:

```sh
$ lein run ~/path/to/upload.zip
```

This will validate the data, import it into Postgres, and generate an
XML feed.

The last line logged will be a Clojure map with information about the
run, including:

* its `import-id` which is used pervasively in the Postgres database
  as the `results_id` column in almost every table
* the location of the SQLite scratch database used during processing
* the location of the XML file generated

When diagnosing problems with processing, those can help you get
started.

### Docker

If you'd like to run data-processor locally exactly as it's run in
production, you will need Docker.

Configuration in Docker is set via the `.env` file in the root of the
project. Create that file, copy the following into it and provide
values for each environment variable.

```
DB_PORT_5432_TCP_ADDR=
DB_ENV_POSTGRES_USER=
DB_ENV_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
DB_ENV_POSTGRES_DATABASE=
POSTGRES_USER=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
VIP_DP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY=
VIP_DP_AWS_SECRET_KEY=
VIP_DP_S3_UNPROCESSED_BUCKET=
VIP_DP_S3_PROCESSED_BUCKET=
VIP_DP_S3_REGION=
VIP_DP_SQS_REGION=
VIP_DP_SQS_QUEUE=
VIP_DP_SQS_FAIL_QUEUE=
VIP_DP_RABBITMQ_EXCHANGE=
VIP_DP_MAX_ZIPFILE_SIZE=(3221225472 = 3GB by default)
```

As you can see, you'll need to have set up two S3 buckets and two SQS
queues.

There are two different places to set the region, one for S3 and one for
SQS and the libraries we use require different forms of this setting. The
`VIP_DP_S3_REGION` setting needs to be in the form of `us-east-1`.
The value for `VIP_DP_SQS_REGION` is in the form of
`US_WEST_2` (not `us-west-2`). The value for
`VIP_DP_RABBITMQ_EXCHANGE` is whatever you'd like it to be.

Running it is as per usual for docker-compose:

```sh
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

While it's running, you can place messages on the SQS queue specified by
`VIP_DP_SQS_QUEUE` and it will be picked up by the processor, downloading the
file in the message, the file will be processed, the database populated, the XML
output zipped up and placed in the bucket specified by
`VIP_DP_S3_PROCESSED_BUCKET`, and a message sent on RabbitMQ to
`VIP_DP_RABBITMQ_EXCHANGE`. While it's running, you can access the PostgreSQL
server running within Docker on port `55432` and RabbitMQ console on port
`55672` (so they don't clash with services that may already be running).

The message you send on the SQS queue must look like the following:

```clj
{:filename "some-feed.xml"}
```

It is an EDN map, with the key `:filename`, whose value is the name of
a file in the `VIP_DP_S3_UNPROCESSED_BUCKET` S3 bucket.

## Testing

### Non-Postgres tests

`lein test`

### Postgres tests

There are two ways you can do this.

#### Local DB

Using a locally running postgres db
`lein test :postgres`

#### Docker

Will create a DB as part of the docker-compose stack
`script/postgres-tests`

## Developing

The processing pipeline is defined as a sequence of functions that
take and return a processing context. The processing context is a map
containing an `:input`, processing functions in `:pipeline`, and
validation failures in `:warnings`, `:errors`, `:critical`, and
`:fatal`.

### The Processing Pipeline

`run-pipeline` function in the `vip.data-processor.pipeline` namespace
takes a context and will thread that context through each function
in its `:pipeline`. Those processing functions may alter the
`:pipeline` (for example, to alter how uploads are loaded into the
database based on file type, or to add extra processing functions only
if all validations are successful).

Any processing function may add a `:stop` key to the processing
context which will halt the processing pipeline, returning the current
context as the final result.

Uncaught exceptions in a processing function will result in a `:stop`
key on the processing context and the exception being added as the
`:exception`.

### Processing Functions

#### Transforms

A processing function may alter the `:input` key for further
processing functions (e.g., `validation.transforms/download-from-s3`,
which takes the `:input` of an incoming context describing the
location of a file on S3, downloads that file, and associates that
file object to the `:input` key of the outgoing context). Such
functions can be called *transforms*.

#### Branches

A processing function may alter the `:pipeline` key, as well, allowing
for branching within a processing pipeline (e.g., XML and CSV files
will need to be transformed differently into a database
representation). Such functions can be called *branches*.

#### Validations

*Validation* functions check _something_ about the context, reporting
any failures in the `:warnings`, `:errors`, `:critical` or `:fatal`
keys of the processing context depending on the severity of the
failure.

The structure of those failure maps is the following: At the top level
is the severity. Next is the scope of the failure (e.g., the filename
or the XML node where the problem lies). Then the kind of problem
(e.g., `:duplicate-rows` or `:missing-headers`). And finally, a
message or sequence of bad data some further error message UI may use
to provide feedback to the use.

For example:

```clj
{:critical
  {"contest.txt"
    {:missing-headers ["election_id", "type"]
     :reference-error {"ballot_id" [{:line 4 "ballot_id" 108}
                                    {:line 6 "ballot_id" 109}]
                       "election_id" [{:line 2 "election_id" 210}]}}}}
```

Validation function are simply functions that accept a processing
context and return one, optionally adding failure report as
above. Typically, they'll look something like the following:

```clj
(defn validate-source-cromulence [ctx]
  (let [source-table (get-in ctx [:tables :sources])]
    (if (cromulent? source-table)
      ctx  ;; everything is okay, just return the context as-is
      (assoc-in ctx [:errors :source :cromulence]  ;; otherwise add error
                "Source is not cromulent"))))
```

To add a validation to all processing, it should be added to the
`pipeline` list in the `vip.data-processor` namespace. If it's only
required for XML or CSV processing, it should be added to the
`xml-validations` or `csv-validations` lists respectively in the
`vip.data-processor.validation.transforms` namespace.


## Deploying

`data-processor` is currently deployed as a [CoreOS cluster][CoreOS] running
atop [AWS EC2][EC2] instances. There are two ways code can be deployed.

### Automatic Deploys

The most common way of deploying new code is by merging an approved PR into the
`master` branch. [Buildkite][buildkite], a continuous integration services,
monitors this repository and triggers a build when code is pushed. For most
branches, the build consists of running a test suite. Code pushed to the
`master` branch - usually by merging an approved pull request - runs the test
suite, and if that is successful, builds a Docker image and deploys it to the
production CoreOS cluster.

### Manual Deploys

In order to manually deploy something other than the `master` branch's `HEAD`,
e.g, to test new features in a staging environment, you'll need to have a few
things:

- `fleetctl` installed (available in Homebrew)
- The public IP address of an EC2 instance in your chosen cluster (aka
  `$FLEETCTL_TUNNEL`), and the appropriate key for that environment added to your ssh-agent, e.g. `ssh-add ~/.ssh/key.pem`.
- A [quay.io account][quay] to use with Docker (run `docker login quay.io` if you haven't
  already)

Begin by checking out the code you want to deploy at a given commit, then run
`script/build`. If the test suite passes, a Docker image is built. Push this
image to Quay as directed by the output of the build script.

Setup your environment for fleet and run `script/deploy`. A successful
deployment should look something like this.

```
$ export FLEETCTL_TUNNEL=an-ip-in-your-cluster
$ ./script/deploy
Agent pid 88741
Destroyed data-processor@.service
Unit data-processor@.service inactive
--- (re-)starting fleet service instances
Destroyed data-processor@1.service
Unit data-processor@1.service inactive

Destroyed data-processor@3.service
Unit data-processor@3.service inactive
Unit data-processor@3.service launched on cea44c01.../10.0.104.31
```

You can verify that a node is running properly by checking its logs.

```sh
$ fleetctl journal -f data-processor@1

## Database Maintenance

`cleanup.feeds_by_election` looks at any election that has more than 5 copies in the database and returns a list of `old_runs` and a list of `new_runs`.

To delete any but the most recent 5 versions of a feed (where two feeds are considered the "same" if they have the same
`state`, `vip_id`, `election_date`, and `election_type`) run

```sql
delete from results where id in (select unnest(old_runs) from cleanup.feeds_by_election);
```
